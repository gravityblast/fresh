/*
Fresh is a command line tool that builds and (re)starts your web application everytime you save a go or template file.

If the web framework you are using supports the Fresh runner, it will show build errors on your browser.

It currently works with Traffic (https://github.com/pilu/traffic), Martini (https://github.com/codegangsta/martini) and gocraft/web (https://github.com/gocraft/web).

Fresh will watch for file events, and every time you create/modifiy/delete a file it will build and restart the application.
If `go build` returns an error, it will logs it in the tmp folder.

Traffic (https://github.com/pilu/traffic) already has a middleware that shows the content of that file if it is present. This middleware is automatically added if you run a Traffic web app in dev mode with Fresh.
